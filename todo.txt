- password security (currently just min 6) + frontend obviously
- logging patient password in requestlogger because it logs the body?
- rate limiter should apply to more (all?) routes, also reinstate correct n
- Check for overexposure of expected errors (asyncHandler)
    - actually, this should not be the handler's responsibility. instead, logger.warn and don't throw error
- email resend queue
- cleanup unverified accounts queue
- refresh token
- check migrate.ts file (currently unused)
- implement logger
- what about min slot duration, min slot separation, max slots per day, earliest / latest slot enforcement?
   - if so, implement storing a users time zone
   - then reinstating no slots over date change is possible - but prolly unnecessary
     because earliest/latest enforcement is better and covers it

- clean up error handler

- make authorizedRequest

- prepareUserResponse: give it a Type (PublicUser)
  - add age? compare to types used
